# Way of Working: Project 3 

The project started with an initial team meeting via discord where after a short team introduction where everyone introduced themselves it was discussed what everyones programming language preferences were. It was decided that Java would be the language of choice for this assignment. 

 Then the team went on to look at projects written in Java that the team would choose to do the assignment with. Our initial choice was an algorithm library however after receiving an email where it said these types of projects were not eligible for us to use in assignment 4 we decided to keep looking. The team then found a project that was an android application. However after running the application in android studio it was a bit unclear how to use it so a third project was found. The third project was the one we finally went with. It had great documentation so getting everything set up and running was really easy.

After finding our project we had another meeting where it was decided how we should work. It was decided that every person should pick one of the methods with the most CCN based on the instructions of the assignment. When working on tasks within the assignment it was decided that one should open an issue corresponding to that task and then create a local branch named after said issue where the person could implement said issue. Finally before the presentation two meetings were held where we discussed progress and worked on the report. 

There was continuous correspondence within the team through a discord server throughout the project.
